## Hey, Everybody ğŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student at __Western Governors University__. Currently have 115 out of 122 credits there.

Currently working through **Codecademy's** Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist path in order to prepare for my capstone at WGU, where I'm planning to make a demand forecasting tool.

I also love to write fiction and draw in my free time!
