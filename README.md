## Hey, Everybody ğŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student at __Western Governors University__. Currently have 118 out of 122 credits there.

Current working on my capstone project at WGU, which is an invasive plant image classifier that uses a CNN.

I also love to write fiction and draw in my free time!
