## Hey, Everybody ğŸ‘‹

I am a current computer science student at __Western Governors University__. Currently have 86 out of 122 credits there.

I'm working through __app/Academy Open__'s self-paced bootcamp curriculum while I am on my term break from college!

I also love to write fiction and draw in my free time!
